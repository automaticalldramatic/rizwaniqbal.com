> I have restored these posts from wayback machine. I was young and stupid then, so I would take my words with a hint of caution too

I have been working on my email signature and, as all web designers do, came up with a fancy one. When you email someone the first time, an email signature creates the first impression. More than your company name and designation, it conveys your attention to detail and creativity. This is the reason why most of us think its blasphemous to not include your company logo in your email signature. However, I soon realized that this, probably, was not the best place to show off.

I have been trying endlessly to get my email signature to work with all the email clients. When it comes to HTML in an email signature, there is only so much you can do. You cannot use most of the background elements because a lot of email clients (including Outlook) just ignore this when rendering the signature. No matter what I did, my recipients ended up with the ‘Allow Images’ pop up.

Now, this wasn’t much of an issue when I was sending emails to people who knew me; an existing client or people I work with. But imagine what would happen if I am trying to pitch to a new client and they get the ‘Allow Images’ pop up (which would happen with more or less 90% of email clients). I send them an email introducing myself and they associate my email to a Phishing Attack. Worse case scenario: they put my email straight to a spam folder. This effects my domain’s spam ranking too.

Because of a stupid image in my email signature, I am now associated with one of the most brutal spam attacks. Also, there are a few other downsides to including images in your signature:

Even small images are a few kilobytes. If I work in a company that enforces its sales team to use email signatures, all this space adds up to a lot of space. Even in a small organization of say a 100 people, the amount of emails that are sent are in 100’s of thousands, multiply this with the size of the image and you know you are dealing with GB’s of space that you are wasting.
Most people use their mobile devices to check emails. If I am communicating regularly with someone who checks their mails on a mobile device, then I am forcing them to download my signature every time they read my emails, this leads to wasting a lot of bandwidth and also makes the whole process slow. God forbid, the guy stops reading my emails completely on his mobile device.
Another common problem is searching for emails. If I send someone an attachment and they want to look for it. They will search for my email with the attachment icon, but now since all my emails have my signature image attached, all of them have an attachment icon against them. This creates a lot of problem looking for an alternate email.
I am writing this article based on the the feedback I received . This is how my signature looked.

Here in India, bandwidth is a serious issue. Most people had to wait for my image to download.

I have collected some really good examples of signatures, they all are surprisingly in text.

Why Text rocks?

Well, it simply rocks. Its hassle free, email clients don’t need to conform to a standard to render it, every email client will display it in the same format and it hardly takes any space.

Now, I use a plain text email signature. I referred to the sitepoint.com blog for some help, but haven’t followed it blindly.

Let me know how you handle your email signatures. Looking forward to your comments on this.
