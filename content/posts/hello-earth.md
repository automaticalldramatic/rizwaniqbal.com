Hello earthlings üññ

This is yet another attempt by me to maintain a journal where I pen down my ramblings. I have in the past tried to discipline myself into writing regularly, but most of my attempts have ended in one lifeless heap of articles only found on the Wayback machine now. 

> I currently serve as Director of Engineering at Grammarly, where I lead teams responsible for developing and maintaining client surfaces across various platforms. It's a role that constantly teaches me new things about technology, leadership, and the art of building products that make a difference in people's lives.

In my free time I like to hack in Go, Typescript, Dart, Swift and anything else that could hold my attention for more than a week.

Feel free to leave a comment or reach out to me via other channels.

I hope we all learn something from this endeavor.
