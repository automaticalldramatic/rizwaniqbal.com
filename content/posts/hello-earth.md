Hello earthlings ðŸ––

This is yet another attempt by me to maintain a journal where I pen down my ramblings. I have in the past tried to discipline myself into writing regularly, but most of my attempts have ended in one lifeless heap of articles only found on the Wayback machine now. 

I have revived this personal blog in addition to the articles I share on Medium; there is a clear distinction for me regarding articles I share on Medium and articles I share only on this website. My personal blog is, as it suggests, is more personal. Its opinions spanning not only tech and the industry I work with but some social topics and my outlook on life along with the music I like and books I read. 

I currently work with OneFootball as a Manager for the News teams. In my free time I like to hack in Go, Typescript and anything else that could hold my attention for more than a week.

Feel free to leave a comment or reach out to me via other channels.

I hope we all learn something from this endeavor.
