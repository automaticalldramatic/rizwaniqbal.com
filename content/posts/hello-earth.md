Hello earthlings ðŸ––

This is yet another attempt by me to maintain a journal where I pen down my ramblings. I have in the past tried to discipline myself into writing regularly, but most of my attempts have ended in one lifeless heap of articles only found on the Wayback machine now. 

I currently work with OneFootball as a Manager for the News teams. In my free time I like to hack in Go, Typescript, Dart, Swift and anything else that could hold my attention for more than a week.

Feel free to leave a comment or reach out to me via other channels.

I hope we all learn something from this endeavor.

_TchÃ¼s_
